# Smart Traffic System for Ambulance Detection 🚑

## 📌 Overview
A **real-time traffic control system** that uses **image processing and machine learning** to detect ambulances and prioritize them at traffic signals.  
This project reduces emergency response time by automatically controlling traffic lights when an ambulance is detected.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy  
- **Hardware (optional for deployment):** ESP32-CAM for edge detection  
- **Algorithm:** Custom CNN / Object Detection Model for Ambulance Recognition  

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Traffic camera footage is captured using ESP32-CAM.  
2. Image processing + ML model detects ambulance in frames.  
3. If ambulance detected → traffic signal is overridden to green.  
4. Control signal sent to traffic light controller.
